### Error Handling

Errors are caught globally using middleware `error-handler.js` with the help of
library
[express-async-errors](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-async-errors) for
catching Async Errors. The library throws any async error without having to pass
it to the next middleware as native Express does.

Instead of writing an Async-wrapper function with try-catch and next(), we throw
the error with the help of `express-async-errors` to our custom error handler in
`error-handler.js` and there do anything, for example show it on the console or
return a message on the browser.
